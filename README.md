# COVID-Crisis
Here, we are going to build an app as a part of our project which will be able to detect this viral disease COVID 19 wherein there will be a chatbot which will be giving some automated responses based on the input given by the user. As for example, if a person is feeling unwell, then he/she can take a self assessment which will be in the form of a chatbot and according to the answers given a person can be diagnosed as either positive or negative. But apart from this, the main features of this app will be selling some essential items like masks/gloves/sanitizers which we are thinking of including in the app which will be sold at much cheaper rates than the market prices so that they become easily available to one and all and no one gets deprived. However, the most attractive part of this app will be adding one more feature of adding sensors to the device.As we know the Aarogya Setu app has self assessment that needs honestly and as seen in news people who run away from hospital after knowing they have COVID 19 and not guilty of spreading it in mass ,from people like them we can't expect honesty.there are many people who even don't have this app installed ,so in such cases where people have a lack of honesty and knowledge having this sensors attached with the device would help in a great way.like the symptoms include fever, cough,difficulty in breathing.So in that case we can have a temperature sensor and also a sensor that detects the breathing rate as cough and difficulty in breathing will surely affect the rate.and once it's confirmed that they have them...they can be registered in a system and sent for further clinical investigation.
